2019-09-17 | This came up as a homework item, but I decided to use it as my actual portfolio project. The assignment was to create a React client app with multiple pages and placeholder text 

### Issues
* **OPEN:** CSS fly-out images in text panes -- The goal was to advertise the images but have them take up minimal space in the layout to be more mobile-friendly. My first attempt was to crop the images in a div and expand them with mouseovers, but it doesn't transition well, and isn't particularly responsive. Also, feedback was that the slim images looked as if they suffered from accidental positioning errors.
* **RESOLVED:** CSS tech icon layout -- Started with css-grid layout but although the positioning of the icons and text in each grid pane was great, it didn't scale to mobile very well. I solved this by abandoning css-grid and using float: left so the grid panes aligned themselves in columns depending on the client width.
