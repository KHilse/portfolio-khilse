        <p>Hi, I'm Kirk Hilse and I'm a Seattle-area software developer</p>
        <p>I've been writing software since the days when total RAM was less than the file size of your current computer's system error beep file. I prefer 'experienced' over 'old' and I prefer the company of younger co-workers.</p>
        <p>I did some fun things while attending the University of Washington in Seattle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I wrote a chorus pedal in <strong>Fortran</strong>
            <li>I created a MIDI sequencer in <strong>SmallTalk</strong>
            <li>I built a simple AI app in <strong>LISP</strong> that took noise and filtered it, turning it into input to write its own music compositions
        </ul>
        <p>After graduating, I went to work at Spectral Inc., a company that made software/hardware digital recording and editing systems for recording studios. Amongst many other duties, I wrote two apps in <strong>C++</strong> that shipped with the product. I worked there for seven years, when the company was purchased by a larger company and dismantled.</p>
        <p>I then spent a short time in contract IT, before taking a 1.5 year role under contract to Microsoft on the Windows Server 2000 project to test Windows Active Directory Administration features</>
