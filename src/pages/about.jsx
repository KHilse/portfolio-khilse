			<p className="about-item">Born on the remote planet of Klaatu, my family moved to Washington State when I was 10 earth years old. We wanted to live amongst the biological life forms you Humans refer to as 'trees.'</p>
			<p className="about-item">I work very well with Humans displaying many different neurological traits. For some, that makes me a good fit in the socio-anthropomorphic role of 'team lead'.</p>
			<p className="about-item">I'm attempting to achieve acceptance in a socio-economic heirarchical organization called a 'company' that will allow me to achieve my personal life goal of world domination through despotic hegemony.</p>
